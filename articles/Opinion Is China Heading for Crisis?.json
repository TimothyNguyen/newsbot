{"text": "In 2001, Gordon Chang, an American lawyer who had spent many years in Hong Kong and Shanghai, published a book forebodingly titled \u201cThe Coming Collapse of China.\u201d At the time, the thesis seemed improbable, if not preposterous.\n\nIt looks a great deal less improbable now.\n\nChina \u2014 or, rather, the Chinese regime \u2014 is in trouble. Tuesday\u2019s gigantic parade in Beijing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic looked like something out of the late Brezhnev era: endless military pomp and gray old men. Hong Kong is in its fourth straight month of protests, marked and stained by this week\u2019s shooting of a teenage demonstrator. The Chinese economy is growing at its slowest rate in 27 years, even when going by the overstated official figures.\n\nMeantime, capital is fleeing China \u2014 an estimated $1.2 trillion in the past decade \u2014 while foreign investors sour on Chinese markets. Beijing\u2019s loudly touted Belt-and-Road initiative looks increasingly like a swamp of corruption, malinvestment and bad debt. Its retaliatory options in the face of Donald Trump\u2019s trade war are bad and few. And General Secretary Xi Jinping has created a cult-of-personality dictatorship in a style unseen since Mao Zedong, China\u2019s last disastrous emperor.\n\nRemember the \u201cChinese Dream\u201d \u2014 Xi\u2019s vision of China as a modern, powerful, and \u201cmoderately well-off\u201d state? Forget it. The current task for Chinese leadership is to avoid a full-blown nightmare of international isolation, economic decline, and domestic revolt.", "article title": "Opinion | Is China Heading for Crisis?", "meta information": {"meta description": "The protests in Hong Kong accelerate the contradictions in Beijing.", "publish date": null, "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/03/opinion/03stephensWeb/merlin_161940225_d01efe35-bae7-41d8-8ce3-dd8193d4a118-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "authors": ["Bret Stephens"], "meta keywords": ""}}
