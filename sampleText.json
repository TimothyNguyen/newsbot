{"articles": [{"text": "A sports needle-mover in the truest sense, Canadian tennis star Bianca Andreescu has enjoyed a stunning rise on the WTA Tour.\n\nThe country and the world have joined her for the ride.\n\nAndreescu's ranking has risen exponentially in her breakout 2019 season. The television ratings have also been huge and the massive increase to her social media following is just as eye-popping.\n\n\"The rise has been tremendous but it's also been sustainable and consistent,\" said Tom Mayenknecht, a Vancouver-based marketing communications executive and sport business commentator.\n\nAndreescu's Instagram account had a modest 12,600 followers at the end of 2018, when she was ranked No. 152 in the world and still looking for her first WTA title.\n\nThe 19-year-old native of Mississauga, Ont., added 58,000 followers in the month of March after her breakthrough win at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, Calif. Her Rogers Cup crown last month in Toronto helped boost her follower total to over 197,000. Andreescu's recent U.S. Open title and the media blitz that followed rocketed that number to 644,000 and counting.\n\nMike Naraine, an assistant professor with Brock University's department of sport management, said Andreescu has picked her spots nicely with social media posts, helping her build a strong brand with a growing base of supporters.\n\n\"It allows her to draw upon a new base of partners,\" Naraine said from Melbourne in a recent interview. \"They look at her and say, 'Wow, there is this new demographic that's young, that's hip, that's very active in the sports community. We can leverage her visibility as a strong Canadian female star to develop our product.\"'\n\nAndreescu already has anchor sponsors in Nike, BMW, Head and Rogers. A spokesman for the Octagon sports and entertainment agency said Andreescu is expected to make announcements on two new major sponsors over the coming weeks.\n\n\"It's a great journey so far but hopefully only the beginning,\" her agent, Jonathan Dasnieres de Veigy, said from Paris.\n\nCurrently ranked fifth in the world, Andreescu will soon return to action at the China Open in Beijing. The US$8.29-million Premier Mandatory-level event begins Saturday and runs through Oct. 6. Andreescu will face world No. 51 Aliaksandra Sasnovich of Belarus in the first round.\n\nIt will be her first tournament since defeating Serena Williams in the U.S. Open final three weeks ago, a win that sent her into another stratosphere. She pocketed a cool US$3.85 million for the win at the final Grand Slam of the season in New York and made high-profile television appearances on \"The View,\" \"The Tonight Show\" and \"Good Morning America\" among others.\n\n\"I'm just visualizing some of the talk-show interviews that she did and the way she handled herself, it made her real to people and accessible to people,\" Mayenknecht said. \"That's what makes her so popular.\"\n\nAndreescu seems just as natural, comfortable and grounded as a Grand Slam champion as she did nine months ago when she was battling through qualifying draws and playing lower-tier tournaments.\n\n\"She's well poised,\" Naraine said. \"It's almost as if she's been training for this her whole life. We don't necessarily see that with a lot of youth athletes.\"\n\nDasnieres de Veigy credits the \"full team\" around Andreescu that keeps her focused.\n\n\"We really want to be careful on that,\" he said. \"Our vision is very long-term. We truly believe that it was not a one-time thing but just the first step of maybe a long career. That's what we really want for her.\"\n\nAndreescu had a modest 4,000 followers on Twitter at the start of the year. That total rose over tenfold by the Rogers Cup in August and is now pushing 190,000.\n\nShe has the most mentioned Canadian athlete account of 2019, ahead of NBA prospect R.J. Barrett at No. 2 and NHL player Brad Marchand at No. 3.\n\n\"Very few Canadian athletes have ever seen such a surge in Twitter conversation within a calendar year,\" Twitter Canada communications head Cam Gordon said in an email.\n\nThe television ratings for Andreescu's 6-3, 7-5 win over Williams were off the charts. Numeris data showed an average audience of 3.4 million viewers watched the match, making it the most-watched tennis broadcast ever on TSN and RDS.\n\nThe audience peaked at 5.3 million viewers for match point, or about one in seven Canadians. ESPN also enjoyed record ratings in the United States.\n\nDAZN Canada, a streaming service, will reap the benefits of Andreescu's immediate return to the hardcourt. It is the domestic rightsholder for the China Open, although many matches will be played in the wee hours across North America.\n\nTSN has the rights to the four Grand Slams and select ATP Tour events while Sportsnet has the Rogers Cup, Davis Cup and Fed Cup. DAZN Canada has had the WTA Tour and ATP 250 tournaments on its lineup since the platform's domestic launch in July 2017.\n\nAndreescu's next set of goals includes cracking the top three in the world rankings and qualifying for the Oct. 27-Nov. 3 WTA Finals in Shenzhen, China.\n\n\"She's going to be under more and more scrutiny moving forward but there's every indication that she's got the sustainability of being a growing force for a long time,\" said Mayenknecht, a former director of communications and public relations for Tennis Canada. \"If that happens, she's only going to continue to convert a lot of fans.\"\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 27, 2019.", "article title": "Bianca Boom: Canadian tennis star Andreescu moves the needle in a big way", "meta information": {"meta description": "A sports needle-mover in the truest sense, Canadian tennis star Bianca Andreescu has enjoyed a stunning rise on the WTA Tour.", "publish date": "2019-09-27T11:26:00-04:00", "image": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/polopoly_fs/1.4613431.1569597917!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.jpg", "authors": ["Gregory Strong"], "meta keywords": "", "url": "https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/bianca-boom-canadian-tennis-star-andreescu-moves-the-needle-in-a-big-way-1.4613421"}}, {"text": "(Reuters) - Global media coverage of petrol bombs, tear gas and street clashes in Hong Kong days before China wants to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\u2019s Republic presents Beijing with a major public relations challenge.\n\nMillions of anti-government protesters have taken to Hong Kong\u2019s streets for more than three months, plunging the Chinese-ruled city into its biggest crisis in decades and posing a direct challenge to its political masters in Beijing.\n\nFollowing are the key dates in Hong Kong\u2019s protest movement and the most recent developments as reported by Reuters.\n\nSaturday Sept. 28 - The fifth anniversary of the \u201cUmbrella\u201d pro-democracy protests in 2014 that occupied parts of the city for 79 days.

It is further divided administratively into the Leh district, which is predominantly Buddhist, and the Kargil district, which is mostly Muslim. There have been occasional border skirmishes between India and China. On October 31, New Delhi will seize control of the region raising fears about the future in both the Buddhist and Muslim communities, although so far the tensions have been confined to cultural and political differences, without violence. However, India and China have a long history of tension in the Ladakh and Doklam regions where border disputes have led to skirmishes as recently as last month. In 1962, a war between New Delhi and Beijing was sparked in the Kashmir region spilling into Ladakh, with conflict engulfing the Himalayan territory for a month.\n\nBut the tensions have not faded since then, with ongoing disputes provoking sporadic spikes in military gesturing. In 2017, a standoff occurred at the Doklam border as India resisted a road being built in the region by China, and earlier this month, Chinese and Indian military clashed again when the Chinese People's Liberation Army objected to Indian patrols in Ladakh. Now, unease in Ladakh could be on the horizon with divides between Buddhist and Muslim communities looming. Muslim residents want to remain tied to the Kashmir Valley while Buddhists celebrate the prospect of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking control of the region on October 31. However, it has emerged that China President Xi Jinping has pushed increasingly audacious foreign policy over Ladakh, with analysts concerned that New Delhi may be losing control in the region.\n\nAshok Malik, distinguished fellow of New Delhi\u2019s Observer Research Foundation told the Financial Times: \"Even in hitherto uncontested parts of Ladakh, the superiority of Chinese infrastructure and military capacities has seen a creeping takeover of border areas. \u201cIt is as if the effective line of actual control keeps moving a couple of inches in the direction of India. At some point, India has to say, \u2018thus far and no further\u2019.\u201d It is also believed that Chinese military intervention in the region is breaching areas overseen by Modi's administration.\n\nBrahma Chellaney, a professor of strategic studies at New Delhi\u2019s Centre for Policy Research told the Financial Times: \"Even before the Indian action on Jammu and Kashmir, the line of actual control between China and India in Ladakh had already become more active because of increasing Chinese aggressiveness. \u201cIn the 12 months prior to August, there had been a sharp increase in the number of Chinese military forays and incursions, and the Chinese have laid claim to several areas that are currently under Indian administrative control.\" DON'T MISS:\n\nIndia-Pakistan crisis: Fears of war after cross-border shelling\u00a0[INSIGHT]\n\nIndia-Pakistan conflict: Modi's office targets Turkish shipyard\u00a0\u00a0[ANALYSIS]\n\nSouth China Sea tensions surge: Vietnam urges India to back them\u00a0[BREAKING]\n\nThis weekend, Xi Jinping will visit New Delhi for talks with Modi, with the situation in Kashmir bound to be a talking point with the two leaders looking to come to a compromise.

My chest is hurting, I need to go to hospital.\"\n\nVideo of the shooting shows a police officer opening fire with a revolver at a man swinging what appears to be a metal pole, as a group of protesters confront riot police.\n\nPolice say their officers were attacked and the policeman who opened fire did so as he \"felt his life was under serious threat\".\n\n\"He fired a round at the assailant to save his own life and his colleagues' lives,\" Senior Supt Yolanda Yu Hoi-kwan was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post.\n\nInvestigations will be conducted into the shooting and an allegation of assault against the young man, police chief Stephen Lo was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post.\n\nIn addition to the bullet fired at the young man, five other live rounds were fired at various locations on Tuesday, police say.\n\n\"Our national day is supposed to be a day to celebrate and be happy,\" said the police chief.\n\n\"But unfortunately some rioters chose to do all this all these sorts of criminal damages, arsons, wounding, assaulting police officers, and various [other] behaviours. Which are more or less equivalent to a riot offence.\"\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called for restraint and de-escalation in the former British territory, saying: \"Whilst there is no excuse for violence, the use of live ammunition is disproportionate and only risks inflaming the situation.\"\n\nPolice tried to disperse the protesters - some of whom were armed with petrol bombs, projectiles or poles - with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon, the latter spraying blue dye to make it easier to identify them later.\n\nIn response to heavy-handed policing, some protesters have become increasingly confrontational, BBC Newsnight international editor Gabriel Gatehouse reports from Hong Kong.\n\n\"If I get shot in the head and I die, it's okay,\" one radical told him. \"This might raise the awareness of society.\"\n\nAt least 15 metro stations and numerous shopping centres in the city were closed, and some 6,000 officers were deployed in the territory.\n\nProtests in Hong Kong by now follow a familiar rhythm - peaceful mass marches which then slide into violence. What stood out today however was the swiftness with which the violence exploded.\n\nAcross many parts of Hong Kong, protesters fought pitched battles with police, with one clash culminating in a young man getting shot by a live round. Authorities appeared to show a new determination to put down the protests as quickly as possible on China's National Day, perhaps to save face, but it inevitably only angered the protesters even more.\n\nOn the streets of Hong Kong Island's dense downtown, from Admiralty to Causeway Bay, protesters played cat and mouse with police, setting a trail of fires in their wake. Police relentlessly attempted to box them in by sending water cannon and elite forces down main roads, while smaller teams charged up side streets.\n\nBut at times the tactics on both sides made little sense and threatened to spin out of control. Petrol and smoke bombs alike were sometimes hurled inexpertly, seriously endangering reporters and passers-by.\n\nIn Admiralty, I saw protesters armed just with umbrellas repeatedly attempting to charge up an escalator to an overhead bridge where riot police were stationed. After shouting warnings, police let loose a barrage of tear gas directly at the protesters, shot at extremely close range. Then in Wan Chai, protesters decided to set a bonfire right in front of a petrol station that was sandwiched between residential blocks - it was quickly put out.\n\nDusk settled; the mayhem continued. I'd started the day with a peaceful, festive mass march that began in Causeway Bay, and hours later found myself right back where I'd started, this time dodging fires and running from police, following that Hong Kong protest rhythm to its inevitable bitter end.\n\nHong Kong has been a part of China since 1997 but has its own system of law and government - known as One Country Two Systems.\n\nIn recent years, there has been increasing opposition to what has been seen as the growing influence of Beijing on Hong Kong's society and politics.\n\nHong Kong always sees anti-Beijing protests on 1 October, and this year they were expected to be larger than ever, because of the months of unrest triggered by proposed changes to the extradition law.\n\nThe changes would have made it possible for China to extradite people to the mainland from Hong Kong, something opponents felt put Hong Kongers at risk of persecution in unfair trials.\n\nFor nearly four months, protesters have taken to the streets - at times reported to be in the millions.\n\nThe proposed changes to the extradition law have officially been scrapped but that has failed to quell the unrest, which has now evolved into an existential battle over Hong Kong's future.\n\nSpeaking from a podium in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, President Xi said no force could stop China's onward march.\n\nDressed in a Mao suit, he watched the parade which featured some military hardware on show for the first time.\n\nThe highly choreographed event presented an image of national unity and gave no hint at the difficulties faced by China's Communist leaders during the last seven decades, or their current problems.", "article title": "Activist shot amid Hong Kong protests", "meta information": {"meta description": "Police hit a protester in the chest, in the first live round shooting in months of unrest.", "publish date": null, "image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/720x405/p07l0fpz.jpg", "authors": [], "meta keywords": "", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-49891403"}}, {"text": "About Your Privacy on this Site\n\nWelcome!
