{"text": "The chair dangles in a gallery titled \u201cBefore and After Tiananmen,\u201d exploring themes of modernization and urbanization in the years around the 1989 massacre. It\u2019s one of the bolder forays in the museum\u2019s contemporary section, which makes heavy demands of American audiences less familiar with Chinese history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to look at this moment in \u201989, and everything it represents about the changing nature of Chinese society and of Chinese art,\u201d said Stuart Comer, the chief curator of media and performance. The era, he added, saw artists in Beijing \u201creally embrace photography, video and performance. We\u2019re still just beginning to address China properly.\u201d\n\nNearly every curator I spoke to, when asked to name the museum\u2019s most transformative undertaking of recent years, mentioned its in-house global think-tank, Contemporary and Modern Art Perspectives. Founded 10 years ago by Kathy Halbreich, MoMA\u2019s recently departed associate director, C-MAP was the museum\u2019s response to the Guggenheim, the Louvre and others establishing franchises in the Middle East and Asia.\n\nThe museum rejected the idea of multiple MoMAs, Mr. Lowry said, turning instead to what he called \u201cself-education.\u201d They invited over colleagues from Latin America, Eastern Europe, South and East Asia. More than 60 MoMA curators and researchers took regular trips to India, South Africa or Brazil. They were learning, listening, decentering themselves.\n\nIn a large new space overlooking West 53rd Street, Mr. Comer conferred with the artist Sheela Gowda, who\u2019d come from Bangalore to set up a room-size installation, which joins thousands of carved wood figurines with the door jambs of torn-down houses. She is one of four Indian women included in MoMA\u2019s initial collection display, and they are joined by artists from Colombia and Argentina, Sierra Leone and Morocco, Poland and Romania.\n\n\u201cWe are of our time, inevitably, and we don\u2019t want to fight that,\u201d said Ms. Temkin a few days later. \u201cWe want, we need, to be of it. Matisse said a great painter had to be of his time.\u201d", "article title": "The New MoMA Is Here.
